## Usage

> [!NOTE]  
> The theme is a constant work in progress, given the quick development pace of Obsidian itself and the user-made plugin scene.
> Currently, the default editor text uses a base64-encoded version of Friedrich Althausen's font [Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com).
>
> The theme was also a runner up in 🎉 [Obsidian's 2022 Gems of the Year](https://obsidian.md/blog/2022-goty-winners/) awards.
> Thank you to everyone who voted.

This theme provides the full range of Catppuccin palettes when
used with the
[Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings#obsidian-style-settings-plugin)
plugin
(see [here](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Community+plugins)
for more on using plugins with Obsidian).

This plugin will allow users to pick from several variations on
Catppuccin, including accents for each color in the palette and
one that features the full host of Catppuccin colors (the
default). New options will be exposed through the Style Settings
plugin over time.

### Obsidian theme store

To install from the Obsidian theme store:

Open Obsidian and go to `Preferences` >> `Appearance`,
click `Manage` and scroll down to 'Community Themes.' Type '
Catppuccin' in the filter bar and then click 'Use' under the
theme name.

To use Catppuccin Latte, set the `Base color scheme` option to `Light`.
For one of the three dark themes, set `Base color scheme` to `Dark`.
This defaults to Catppuccin Mocha; install Style Settings as described below to change your dark theme flavor to Frappé or Macchiato.

### Style Settings plugin installation and use

A note on Style Settings setup from [pitoniak32](https://github.com/pitoniak32):

> To install Style Settings, open Obsidian's `Preferences`, and navigate to the
> OPTIONS section, select `Community plugins` and ensure that `Restricted Mode` is
> off.
>
> Now you can search
> for "[Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings#obsidian-style-settings-plugin)"
> by mgmeyers.
> Once you have the plugin installed, you should be able to see a heading
> entry `Style Settings` on the left under `COMMUNITY PLUGINS` in
> the `Preferences` window.
>
> From there you can select, and configure your Catppuccin flavor, and make
> customizations :)

## Problems?

Obsidian is a large and constantly expanding app with a variety
of use cases and plugins. If you run into theme-related issues or
want CSS adjustments made for your favorite plugin(s),
please [open an issue](https://github.com/catppuccin/obsidian/issues).
While there is
a [Discord community](https://discord.com/channels/907385605422448742/1027435548165558303)
for the theme, using GitHub Issues is good for the development
process, [less ephemeral](https://karl-voit.at/2020/10/23/avoid-web-forums/),
and helps other users who need support or want to contribute.
