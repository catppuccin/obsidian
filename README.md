## About

This is the Catppuccin theme for the note-taking app Obsidian.
The theme is a constant work in progress, given the quick
development pace of Obsidian itself and the user-made plugin
scene.

## Usage

This theme provides the full range of Catppuccin palettes when
used with the
[Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings#obsidian-style-settings-plugin)
plugin
(see [here](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Community+plugins)
for more on using plugins with Obsidian).
This plugin will allow users to pick from several variations on
Catppuccin, including accents for each color in the palette and
one that features the full host of Catppuccin colors (the
default). New options will be exposed through the Style Settings
plugin over time.

### Obsidian theme store

To install from the Obsidian theme store:

Open Obsidian and go to `Preferences` >> `Appearance`,
click `Manage` and scroll down to 'Community Themes.' Type '
Catppuccin' in the filter bar and then click 'Use' under the
theme name.

### Style Settings plugin installation and use

To install Style Settings, open Obsidian's Settings page and
navigate to `Community plugins` in the left-hand sidebar.
Disable `Restricted mode` if you have not already and then,
under `Community plugins`, click `Browse`.
Search "Style Settings" by mgmeyers and install. You should now
see a tab for `Style Settings` in your left-hand sidebar. Click this tab to
adjust the theme's appearance. Credit to

## Problems?

Obsidian is a large and constantly expanding app with a variety
of use cases and plugins. If you run into theme-related issues or
want CSS adjustments made for your favorite plugin(s),
please [open an issue](https://github.com/catppuccin/obsidian/issues).
While there is
a [Discord community](https://discord.com/channels/907385605422448742/1027435548165558303)
for the theme, using GitHub Issues is good for the development
process, [less ephemeral](https://karl-voit.at/2020/10/23/avoid-web-forums/),
and helps other users who need support or want to contribute.
